# thesis-sp18-cooper-networks
The purpose of this thesis is to continue the research of social network inference under restrictions. In this thesis I will explore alternative models such as ERGMâ€™s and latent space models in the context of a restricted unobserved network. I will answer the following questions: How do estimates from these models compare to those from a fixed-rank likelihood approach? What aspects of a network are captured well by these models, and which aspects are not captured well? This thesis includes some statistical theory on modeling networks, conducting inference, latent spaces, and other concepts. It also includes the application of these ideas to a sample dataset, where the results of the analysis will be compared to that of past research.
